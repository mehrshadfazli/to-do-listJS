Build an attractive to-do list !

-------------------------------------

Hi guys . In this mini-project, I tried to create a simple to-do list using various javascript concepts, including localStorage. This mini-project is very useful for learning various javascript concepts.
You can even categorize works according to different criteria and display them. I hope this mini-project is useful for you.

My goal in doing this project was to master more javascript. In this project, I tried to write the functions in JavaScript as simply as possible.All required files are uploaded here.

peace :)
